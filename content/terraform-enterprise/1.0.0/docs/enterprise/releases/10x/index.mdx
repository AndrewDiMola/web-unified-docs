\* Denotes a <strong>required release</strong>. All online upgrades will automatically install this version, but airgap customers must upgrade to this version before proceeding to later releases.

\** The release package contains this version of the Terraform CLI, but you can install older and newer versions of the Terraform CLI as needed via the Admin [UI](/terraform/enterprise/application-administration/resources#managing-terraform-versions) or [API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/admin/terraform-versions).

\+ This release is unavailable.

## 1.0.0
# Terraform Enterprise 1.0.0

Last required release: [v202406-1 (776)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:3e48ce529c1cb40217b4526c93a8bc345482184e0c8d1073b3efbaaa6e0057d0`

## Known Issues

1. The **Create a team token** button in the Teams Tokens page may not always be visible. The workaround for this issue is to navigate to the Teams page and then back to the API Tokens page.

## Deprecations
1. Terraform Enterprise is transitioning from monthly releases to quarterly releases. We are also changing from a date-based version scheme to a semantic versioning-like scheme. Each version is numbered according to milestone, major, and patch release represented as `x.y.z`. Under this scheme, we will publish a milestone or major release quarterly. Releases will receive monthly patches until the next quarterly release becomes available. This change is intended to provide a more predictable and stable release cycle, allowing for better planning and implementation of updates. **The last monthly release with `YYYYMMDD` versioning will be in July. The first quarterly release with `x.y.z` versioning will be 1.0.0 in August.**

## Highlights

1. You can now authenticate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server using a managed identity.

## Improvements

1. State version content size constraints have been revised for loading state JSON and state JSON diff, which will result in a faster page loading experience for most users.
2. Site admins can now change their password even when logged in using SSO. An alert also displays in the SAML settings page. The alert states that admins can log in with their username and password even when SSO is enabled.

## Bug Fixes

1. Users reported inconsistent results on the Team Tokens API page where an "Only admins can manage" message may have incorrectly appeared. Users had been blocked from deleting or regenerating Team tokens, even when they had permission to perform these actions. This bug has been resolved and the "Permissions" and "Actions" columns should render correctly.

1. You can now access the organization profile page, even if your team has minimal permissions and auto-delete data retention is enabled, which fixes 404 errors for least-privileged users.

1. Private registry module uploads that are interrupted by authentication revocation are now marked as failed instead of remaining stuck in a queueing state.

1. `workspace_names` and `agent_pool_names`  filters in the `/organizations/:organization_name/runs` API endpoint now respond correctly for runs that belong to workspaces and agent pools with names containing uppercase letters.
