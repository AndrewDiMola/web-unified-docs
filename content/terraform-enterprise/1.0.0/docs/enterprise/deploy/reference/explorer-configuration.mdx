# Explorer on Terraform Enterprise Beta configuration reference

This topic contains reference information about the configurations you can specify to run Explorer on Terraform Enterprise. The Explorer beta is available with Terraform Enterprise 1.0.0. 

<Note title="Beta Warning">

Explorer on Terraform Enterprise is in BETA and should not be run in production environments. There may be patches or bugs during the course of the beta that require you to destroy the Explorer database entirely. Running Explorer may increase the load on the Terraform Enterprise server in unexpected ways, resulting in slowdowns or outages. 

Please contact your account team with any beta feedback. 

</Note>

## Introduction

In order to enabled Explorer, you will need to provide a new database and specify environment variables to configure Terraform Enterprise to enable Explorer and to store Explorer data. Specify the variables in a configuration file for your runtime environment, such as a [Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/), Kubernetes [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/), or in the `env` block of your [Nomad job](/nomad/docs/job-specification/env). Refer to [Create deployment configuration overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration) for additional information.

The Explorer beta is available with Terraform Enterprise 1.0.0, and is only possible when running in external services or active/active operational modes. Authentication to the Explorer database currently only support username/password - passwordless authentication methods will be added in a future update.


## Explorer settings

### `TFE_EXPLORER_DATABASE_HOST`

Setting this variable will enable the Explorer feature.
