# Define configuration

In the component configuration file, you declare what infrastructure components are part of the Stack.

Your component configuration file defines multiple components that share a lifecycle you can repeatedly deploy. This helps ensure consistency across environments and reduces the complexity of provisioning at scale.

## Background

You declare the infrastructure that makes up your Stack in the component configuration file. Component configuration files replace Terraform’s traditional root module and serve as the blueprint for what your Stack deploys.

Component configuration files use a new file type, `tfcomponent.hcl`, to define everything that shares your Stack’s lifecycle. After writing your component configuration, you can write a deployment configuration to dictate how HCP Terraform deploys your Stack’s infrastructure.

As with Terraform configuration files, HCP Terraform processes all of the blocks in your component configuration and deployment configuration files in your Stack's root directory in dependency order. You can organize your component configuration into multiple files as in traditional Terraform configurations.

### Requirements

Before you begin writing your component configuration, ensure you have the `terraform-stacks-cli` for initializing and validating your component configurations. For installation guidance, refer to the [Stacks CLI reference](/terraform/language/stacks/reference/tfcomponents-cli).

## Define your component configuration

We recommend [designing your Stack](/terraform/language/stacks/design) before you begin writing your configuration files.

All of your Stack’s configuration files must use the `.tfcomponent.hcl` file type. You can set up your component configuration into multiple files as in traditional Terraform configurations. For example, you can have `variables.tfcomponent.hcl`, `providers.tfcomponent.hcl`, and we recommend creating one root-level file for your `component` blocks, such as `components.tfcomponent.hcl`.

The `component` block defines the pieces that make up your Stack. Add a `component` block for each top-level module you want to include in the Stack. Specify the source module, inputs, and providers for each component.

```hcl
# components.tfcomponent.hcl

component "cluster" {
    source = "./eks"
    inputs = {
        aws_region          = var.aws_region
        cluster_name_prefix = var.prefix
        instance_type       = "t2.medium"
    }
    providers = {
        aws       = provider.aws.this
        random    = provider.random.this
        tls       = provider.tls.this
        cloudinit = provider.cloudinit.this
    }
}
```

After establishing your top-level modules, you can use child modules without adding additional `component` blocks.

The component configuration file type accepts most classic Terraform configuration blocks but with some key differences. For more details on declaring providers in Stacks, refer to [Declare providers](/terraform/language/stacks/component/declare-providers). For more information on the component configuration file type and all the blocks and attributes it accepts, refer to the [Configuration file reference](/terraform/language/stacks/reference/tfcomponent).

The `component` block supports the `for_each` meta-argument if you need to replicate components across multiple instances. For example, the following configuration uses `for_each` to provision modules in multiple AWS regions for a given environment.

```hcl
# components.tfcomponent.hcl

component "s3" {
    for_each = var.regions

    source = "./s3"

    inputs = {
        region = each.value
    }

    providers = {
        aws    = provider.aws.configurations[each.value]
        random = provider.random.this
    }
}
```

After writing your component configuration, use the Terraform Stacks CLI to validate it.

## Validate your configuration

Once you have finished your component configuration, use the `terraform-stacks-cli` tool to validate your configuration and generate the necessary provider lock files.

```shell-session
$ tfcomponents init
$ tfcomponents validate
```

For installation guidance and more details, refer to the [Stacks CLI](/terraform/language/stacks/reference/tfcomponents-cli).

## Next steps

If you have not yet defined the providers for your Stack, proceed to [Declare providers](/terraform/language/stacks/component/declare-providers). You can also learn how to [Authenticate your Stack](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/authenticate) to ensure your providers are properly set up.
