# Automate testing

Automated testing validates that your applications and infrastructure work correctly before deployment, reducing the risk of failures in production. Implement testing at multiple levels to catch issues early and ensure consistent quality.

## Application testing

Automate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for your applications. Unit tests validate individual components, integration tests verify component interactions, and end-to-end tests ensure the complete application workflow functions correctly.

Run these tests automatically in your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues before deployment. Use test coverage metrics to ensure comprehensive testing and set quality gates that prevent deployment if tests fail.

## Infrastructure testing

Test your infrastructure changes before applying them to production. Use tools like Terratest to validate that your Terraform configurations create the expected resources and that your infrastructure meets your requirements.

Test infrastructure changes in a staging environment that mirrors production. Validate that your infrastructure supports your application requirements and that security configurations are correct.

## Deployment testing

Test your deployment processes to ensure they work reliably. Use blue-green or canary deployments to test new versions in production-like environments before fully switching over.

Automate post-deployment validation to verify that your application is running correctly and that all services are healthy. Include health checks, smoke tests, and monitoring validation in your deployment process.
