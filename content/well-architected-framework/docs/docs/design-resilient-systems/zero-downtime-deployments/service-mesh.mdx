# Service mesh deployments

You can use service splitters to implement zero-downtime deployments. These
components, often used in service mesh architectures, allow traffic to route
between different versions of an application dynamically.

You can use Consul to help make traffic splitting decisions. Consul proxy
metrics gives you detailed health and performance information about your service
mesh applications. This includes upstream/downstream network traffic metrics,
ingress/egress request details, error rates, and additional performance
information that you can use to understand your distributed applications.

With blue/green deployments, you can configure a service splitter to initially
direct all traffic to your application's "blue" (current) version. When you are
ready to deploy the "green" (new) version, you can gradually adjust the splitter
to shift traffic from blue to green.

You can use Consul to manage traffic for zero downtime deployments using the
following steps:

First, you register your serviceâ€™s blue and green versions with Consul and
configure health checks to monitor the availability and health of each service
instance. Once the instances are healthy, you can deploy your new version to the
green stack, ensure it passes Consul's health checks, and then update traffic
splitting or routing rules to shift traffic from the blue to the green service
gradually.

Since your green service is now receiving traffic, you should monitor the health
and performance of both versions. If issues arise, you can roll back the traffic
to your blue service. Once all health and performance checks pass, you can
decommission the blue service to complete your blue/green deployment.

With canary deployments, you can release new software gradually, and identify
and reduce the potential blast radius of a failed software release. You first
route a small fraction of the service to the new version. Similar to blue/green
deployments, this can be done with a service splitter. When you confirm no
errors, you slowly increase traffic to the new service until you fully promote
the new environment.

Amazon EKS and Azure Kubernetes Service can use Consul service mesh to observe
traffic within your service mesh. This observability enables you to quickly
understand how services interact with each other and effectively debug your
services' traffic.
