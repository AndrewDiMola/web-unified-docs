# Overview

A fault-tolerant system prevents disruptions from a single point of failure, and ensures high availability and business continuity for your mission-critical applications or infrastructure. When you design and implement fault-tolerant systems, you reduce costs, intelligently scale, and minimize downtime. 

Fault-tolerant systems also enhance your business outcomes and increase customer satisfaction in the following ways:

- Ensures critical systems remain available even during failure to support business continuity and minimize the effects of disruptions.
- Failover and redundancy help reduce risk of data loss, corruption, and damage from security breaches.
- Improve the quality of service and deliver better user experience through consistent performance and responsiveness.

HashiCorp tools feature fault-tolerance properties which enhance the overall resiliency and fault tolerance of applications they integrate with. Use the guidance and resources here to help design your fault-tolerant systems with HashiCorp tools.
