# Secure distributed systems

Distributed systems involve several components communicating across networks, which presents an expanded attack surfaces with many potential points of vulnerability. A breach in one component can lead to a cascade through the system, potentially compromising data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. You must implement a robust design that include security measures to prevent data breaches and service disruptions without impairing performance and reliability.

## Quorum

When you deploy a distributed system like Consul, Nomad, or Vault, one of your primary design considerations should be cluster quorum. Quorum refers to the minimum number of nodes in a distributed system required to reach consensus regarding shared state or configuration. Without quorum, the system becomes unreliable and can experience leader election issues, data inconsistencies, or complete loss of consensus.

In a Consul or Vault cluster using high availability integrated storage, quorum is a majority of members from a peer set. For a set of size `N`, quorum requires at least `(N/2)+1` members. For example, if there are 5 members in the peer set, you would need 3 nodes to form a quorum. If a quorum of Consul or Vault nodes is unavailable for any reason, the cluster becomes unavailable and can't commit new logs.

We recommend using three to five servers for both Vault or Consul deployments, including cloud platforms like HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP). We recommend the non-voting or read replication feature available in the Enterprise or HCP editions for large deployments that need to scale reads without impacting write latency. A single server deployment is **highly discouraged** due to inevitable data loss in a failure scenario.

The following are quorum sizes and node failure tolerances for a range of cluster node counts.

| **Servers** | **Quorum** | **Node failure tolerance** |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 4 | 3 | 1 |
| 5 | 3 | 2 |
| 6 | 4 | 2 |
| 7 | 4 | 3 |
