# Redundancy and replication

Your fault-tolerant system design can benefit from redundancy in key hardware and software components to ensure maximum availability and ideal user experience. State replication enables availability and performance by ensuring that a system can continue to operate when components fail.

Some ways in which you can build redundancy into your designs include:

- Duplicate critical service instances
- Redundant data storage solutions from different vendors
- Several network paths for communications
