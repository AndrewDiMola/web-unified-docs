# Networking and communication protocols

Your fault-tolerant applications or infrastructure can benefit from choosing best in class robust networking and communication protocols. Choose solutions which ensure your networks and protocols can survive failure, such as the following:

- Load balancing and distribution solutions
- Network isolation and segmentation techniques
- Caching and content delivery solutions
- Reliable multicast networking
- Connection-oriented networking and service mesh solutions
- Message queue and buffering solutions
