# Plan for resiliency and availability

As you plan for resiliency and availability, you must decide how robust your system architecture needs to be in terms of failure, degradation, and performance. The following are key considerations that you should include when planning for availability and resilience in your deployment:

1. Identify all applications and infrastructure where availability is critical. 
1. Calculate the cost of your failure domain strategy.
1. Decide your uptime goals.
1. Compare your architecture and failure recovery plans to the business requirements (BCP).
