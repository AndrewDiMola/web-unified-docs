# State management and disaster recovery

Disaster recovery considerations are an important part of your organization's overall business continuity planning. You should consider both Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO). 

At a minimum, your recovery plan should include the following:

- State and change management.
- Immutable infrastructure for quick and replicable deployment.
- Automated backups stored on mounted or external storage, instead of local or ephemeral storage.
