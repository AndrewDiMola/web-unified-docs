This document outlines implementation resources for maintaining reliable Terraform clusters. When you implement proper reliability measures, you ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and consistent performance of your Terraform infrastructure.

The following sections cover architecture, monitoring, resource management, and recovery.


## Architecture

The following architecture is Terraform Enterprise architecture for Replicated environments. Terraform Enterprise is now deployed with containers, as described in the [Terraform Enterprise deployment overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy).

<Note>

The discontinued clustered version of Terraform Enterprise is no longer supported, and we strongly advise all customers to move to an Active/Active installation. Please contact your support representative if you need assistance.

</Note>

- Follow [cloud-specific reference architectures](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/architecture/reference-architecture) for Terraform Enterprise deploy to Replicated.

## Monitoring

Monitor your Terraform Enterprise environment to collect telemetry data, view performance, perform audits, and measure infrastructure usage. You can use this data to proactively catch issues and reliably run Terraform Enterprise.

- [Enable logs and metrics in Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/monitoring/logging) so that you can monitor your non-Replicated deployment.

- [Monitor the underlying infrastructure](/well-architected-framework/reliability/reliability-deploy-application-monitoring-components) that Terraform runs on.

## Recovery

Recover Terraform Enterprise in the case of cluster degradation through regular backups.

- Use the [Terraform Enterprise API](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/backup-restore) to back up all the data stored in a Terraform Enterprise installation, including the blob storage and the PostgreSQL database. 

- Configure your [Terraform Enterprise deployment to connect to a PostgreSQL database replica](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/failover) to ensure continuous database availability.

## Resilience

Run a resilient Terraform Enterprise cluster to avoid application downtime.

- [Perform diagnostics](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/perform-diagnostics) on your Terraform Enterprise deployment.
- [Troubleshoot common errors](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/error-messages) Terraform Enterprise may report if you misconfigure your deployment, and how learn to resolve them.


## Next steps

In this document, you learned about the HashiCorp resources for implementing and running a reliable Terraform cluster. The following are implementation guides on the other HashiCorp products.
