# Deploy infrastructure and applications with zero-downtime

Zero-downtime deployment strategies aim to reduce or eliminate downtime when you
update your infrastructure or applications. These strategies involve deploying
new versions incrementally rather than all at once to detect and resolve issues.
Each strategy lets you test the new version in an environment with real user
traffic. This helps validate the new release's performance and reliability.

This guide covers best practices for popular zero-downtime deployment methods,
such as blue/green, canary, and rolling deployments. It will help you decide the
deployment method best for your organization and provide the resources to
implement that method.

<Note>

Stateful workloads like databases require additional work for blue/green,
canary, and rolling deployments. Consult your databaseâ€™s documentation while
considering these zero-downtime strategies.

## Deployment methods overview

Blue/green, canary, and rolling deployments all improve application reliability
and reduce risk. While they share similar goals, each approach offers unique
advantages that make it more suitable for certain types of applications or
organizational needs. By choosing the most appropriate deployment method,
companies can ensure smoother updates and reduce the likelihood of service
disruptions.

- Blue/green deployments maintain two identical production environments
  concurrently. This method allows you to shift traffic from the current version
  (blue) to the upgraded version (green).
- Canary deployments introduce new versions incrementally to a subset of users.
  This approach lets you test upgrades with limited exposure, working alongside
  other deployment systems.
- Rolling deployments update applications gradually across multiple servers.
  This technique ensures only a portion of your infrastructure changes at once,
  reducing the risk of widespread issues.

The difference between these strategies is how and where the application
deploys. This involves the environment the application runs in, cost
considerations, deployment methods, and traffic direction.

- Environment setup:
    - Blue/Green: Requires two nearly identical environments.
    - Canary: Requires two nearly identical environments. Initially uses a small subset of users or servers.
    - Rolling: Updates subsets of servers in batches.
- Traffic switching:
    - Blue/Green: Switches all traffic at once.
    - Canary: Gradually increases traffic to the new version.
    - Rolling: Sequentially updates and transitions traffic.
- Rollback mechanism:
    - Blue/Green: Switching back to the blue environment.
    - Canary: Rollback involves reducing or stopping the canary deployment.
    - Rolling: Rollback involves reverting batches, which can be more complex.

Since all three zero-downtime strategies offer similar benefits and aim to
achieve zero-downtime deployments, the changes you plan to make will be the most
important consideration when determining which deployment to implement. The
changes can be either infrastructure or application.

Infrastructure changes involve setting up your environments so they are prepared
to host your zero-downtime application. With blue/green deployments, you must
have two identical environments. An infrastructure environment can range from
creating a new green full stack (servers, networking, or databases) to creating
a new cluster to run containers or adding a single green VM to an existing
infrastructure stack.

However, it is important to note that running two identical infrastructure
environments can increase costs. You can run blue/green environments only in
production to save money. You should also have an infrastructure lifecycle
strategy, such as using infrastructure-as-code to deploy your green environment
only when you plan to deploy your new application version.

Application changes involve deploying and directing traffic to your new
application version. You can configure your load balancer or reverse proxies to
direct traffic to your green stack and perform canary testing or direct traffic
in a controlled manner for rolling deployments.

Service mesh deployments use service splitters to implement zero-downtime
deployments. These components, often used in service mesh architectures, allow
traffic to route between different versions of an application dynamically.

## Infrastructure changes

Properly managing changes to your infrastructure, such updating network policies
or upgrading your Kubernetes cluster, is important to ensure the reliability of
your upgraded application and achieve zero-downtime deployments.

Blue/green deployments are good for deploying your application on a new
infrastructure. Blue/green deployments require two identical application
infrastructure environments, a method for deploying your application to your two
environments, and a way to route your traffic between them.

The following diagram shows a basic blue/green deployment. The blue environment
is the infrastructure where your current application runs. The green environment
is identical except you upgraded it to host the new version of the application.
This environment can be a set of servers or a new cluster running a new AMI or
container.

![Typical blue green deployment. The green environment is provisioned in parallel with the blue environment. When the green environment is ready, the load balancer directs traffic to the green environment.](/img/terraform/blue-green-canary-tests-deployments/blue-green-deployment.png)

Your blue and green environments need to be as similar as possible.
Infrastructure as code (IaC) lets you describe your environment as code and
consistently deploy identical environments.

IaC makes your operations more cost-effective by allowing you to easily build
and remove resources when you do not need them. Using IaC also lets you spin up
your green environment whenever you need it. Instead of letting your blue and
green environments persist indefinitely or allocating time to build them, you
can deploy your green infrastructure environment when you want to deploy your
new software application. Once your green environment is stable, you can tear
down your blue environment. 

HashiCorp's Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that can help you deploy
and manage  blue/green infrastructure environments. By using Terraform modules,
you can consistently deploy identical infrastructure using the same code but
different environments through variables. You can also define feature toggles in
your Terraform code to create a blue and green deployment environment
simultaneously. You can then test your application in your new green
environment, and then when you are ready, set the toggle in your code to destroy
your blue environment.

## Application changes

Application changes can use blue/green, canary, rolling, or a combination of the
three. Your deployment method depends on if you use virtual machines or
containers, along with the criticality of your application

### Load balancers and proxies

Load balancers and reverse proxies can manage your application by directing
traffic between your blue and green environments. They can then direct a subset
of users for canary deployments and testing and control traffic for rolling
deployments.

Regardless of your cloud provider, you can use Terraform to manage the
deployment and control of load balancers and proxies.

### Non-containerized applications

Using a blue/green or rolling deployment is a good approach if you are deploying
applications on virtual machines.

Blue/green deployments deploys your new application version to your new green
environment. Once you deploy your application, you can start testing the new
version in-house, and once you deem it ready, you can switch production traffic
over to it.

For high-impact applications, we advise incorporating canary testing into your
blue/green deployment strategy. This testing method allows you to validate your
new version before fully transitioning your traffic, ensuring a stable and
desired user experience.

The following is an example of canary testing your green environment:

After the green environment is ready, the load balancer sends a small fraction
of the traffic to the green environment (in this example, 10%).

![Canary test/deployment. All traffic is directed to the blue environment initially. When you perform a canary test, 10% of the traffic is directed to the green environment.](/img/terraform/blue-green-canary-tests-deployments/canary-deployment.png)

If the canary test succeeds without errors, you can incrementally direct traffic
to the green environment (50/50 â€” split traffic) over time. In the end state,
you redirect all traffic to the green environment. After verifying the new
deployment, you can destroy the old blue environment. The green environment is
now your current production service.

![Rolling deployment. After the initial canary test, traffic to the green environment is split evenly with the blue environment (50/50). Finally, all traffic is directed to the green environment.](/img/terraform/blue-green-canary-tests-deployments/rolling-deployment.png)

### Containerized applications

Containers can use rolling, blue/green, and canary deployments, either through
orchestration tools like Nomad and Kubernetes.

Rolling deployments are a popular strategy for deploying applications using
orchestration systems. With rolling deployments, the orchestrator gradually
replaces old instances with new ones. Once the new instances are available and
pass health checks, the orchestrator can direct traffic to the new instances and
then destroy the old instances.

Nomad supports rolling updates as a first-class feature. To enable rolling
updates, you can annotate a job or task group with a high-level description of
the update strategy using the `update` block.

Kubernetes by default uses rolling updates. Kubernetes does this by
incrementally replacing current pods with new ones. The new Pods are scheduled
on Nodes with available resources, and Kubernetes waits for those new Pods to
start before removing the old Pods.

As described in [infrastructure-changes](#infrastructure-changes), both Nomad
and Kubernetes support blue/green deployments. Before sending all your traffic
to your new cluster, you can use canary testing to ensure the new cluster is
working as intended.

## Service mesh deployments

You can use service splitters to implement zero-downtime deployments. These
components, often used in service mesh architectures, allow traffic to route
between different versions of an application dynamically.

You can use Consul to help make traffic splitting decisions. Consul proxy
metrics gives you detailed health and performance information about your service
mesh applications. This includes upstream/downstream network traffic metrics,
ingress/egress request details, error rates, and additional performance
information that you can use to understand your distributed applications.

With blue/green deployments, you can configure a service splitter to initially
direct all traffic to your application's "blue" (current) version. When you are
ready to deploy the "green" (new) version, you can gradually adjust the splitter
to shift traffic from blue to green.

You can use Consul to manage traffic for zero downtime deployments using the
following steps:

First, you register your serviceâ€™s blue and green versions with Consul and
configure health checks to monitor the availability and health of each service
instance. Once the instances are healthy, you can deploy your new version to the
green stack, ensure it passes Consul's health checks, and then update traffic
splitting or routing rules to shift traffic from the blue to the green service
gradually.

Since your green service is now receiving traffic, you should monitor the health
and performance of both versions. If issues arise, you can roll back the traffic
to your blue service. Once all health and performance checks pass, you can
decommission the blue service to complete your blue/green deployment.

With canary deployments, you can release new software gradually, and identify
and reduce the potential blast radius of a failed software release. You first
route a small fraction of the service to the new version. Similar to blue/green
deployments, this can be done with a service splitter. When you confirm no
errors, you slowly increase traffic to the new service until you fully promote
the new environment.

Amazon EKS and Azure Kubernetes Service can use Consul service mesh to observe
traffic within your service mesh. This observability enables you to quickly
understand how services interact with each other and effectively debug your
services' traffic.
