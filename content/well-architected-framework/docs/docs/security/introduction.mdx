# Security pillar introduction

The HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework helps you migrate
workloads to a multi-cloud architecture that is secure, reliable,
high-performing, and resilient. 
The Security pillar defines a [zero trust](https://www.hashicorp.com/solutions/zero-trust-security) 
architecture approach and best practices to protect your applications,
secure your networks, manage sensitive data, manage identity and access, and
build security controls.

## Transition to zero trust architecture

Multi-cloud infrastructure means a shift from host-based identity to
application-based identity, with zero trust networks that do not have a clear
network perimeter.

In the traditional security approach, internal networks have high trust, which
creates a hardened exterior security boundary with a less secure interior environment. With modern zero trust architecture,
no trust is implicitly granted between systems, which creates a hardened interior environment. The hardened interior environment
requires that interior applications explicitly authenticate and authorize to perform
sensitive operations, such accessing secrets.

HashiCorp's portfolio for zero trust security in the multi-cloud environment includes Vault, Consul, and Boundary.

HashiCorp Vault verifies the machines' or applications' identities to determine their authorization level. 
For example, application A is allowed to read data from a production database.

Vault focuses on the protection of sensitive data. 
It provides data encryption and tokenization capabilities, as well as dynamic generation of database credentials, 
Kubernetes service accounts, etc. 

Vault provides practitioners a path to implement zero trust security. 
Vault provides secure storage and controlled access to tokens,
passwords, certificates, and encryption keys to protect application infrastructure and sensitive data.

HashiCorp Consul provides practitioners a path to implement zero trust networking,
provides secure service discovery, and service mesh functionality across multiple cloud providers.

HashiCorp Boundary provides practitioners a path to implement zero trust security by enabling
access to hosts and critical systems with fine-grained authorizations based on
trusted identities without having to manage credentials or expose your network.

## Best Practices

HashiCorp's Security pillar provides best practices to:

- [Protect your applications](#protect-applications)
- [Secure your network](#secure-the-network)
- [Manage sensitive data](#manage-sensitive-data)
- [Manage identity and access](#manage-identity-and-access)
- [Codify security controls](#codify-security-controls)

### Protect applications

It is best practice to encrypt application data both at rest and in transit. 
Encrypting this data will help secure your application from outside threats, 
and keep sensitive data out of the wrong hands.

Application data is at rest when stored on a disk or in a database.
Enterprises should strive to automatically protect data in MySQL, MongoDB,
PostgreSQL, and other databases with transparent data encryption (TDE).
Additionally, enterprises that have high security requirements for data
compliance (PCI=SS, HIPAA, etc) and cryptographically-protected anonymity for
personally identifiable information (PII), data protection methods should
include data tokenization, such as data masking. This enables enterprises to
protect sensitive customer data such as credit card numbers, sensitive personal
information, and bank account numbers.

To secure application communication in transit, enterprises need to implement
fine-grained service segmentation with automatic TLS encryption and
identity-based authorization. For multi-cloud workloads, enterprises should
implement [centralized PKI and certificate management](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/pki-with-vault) 
with HashiCorp Vault.

Traditional solutions for safeguarding user access have typically required you to
distribute and manage SSH keys, VPN credentials, and configure bastion hosts, which
creates risks around mismanaging credentials and users having access to entire
networks and systems. HashiCorp Boundary secures access to applications and
critical systems with fine-grained authorizations without managing credentials
or exposing your network.


### Secure the network

For many enterprises, the realities of cloud adoption often require
a shift from a traditional on-premise static infrastructure with clearly defined
network perimeters, to cloud infrastructure that is highly dynamic and has less
clear network perimeters.

This shift in operating models requires a fundamentally different approach to
security. Instead of focusing on a secure network perimeter with the assumption
of trust, the focus is to acknowledge that the network in the cloud is
inherently "low trust" and move to the idea of securing infrastructure and
application services themselves through a trusted source of identity and secrets
management.

Cloud networking is one of the most difficult
aspects of adopting an enterprise cloud operating model. The combination
of dynamic IP addresses, 
microservices, and the lack of a clear network perimeter is a
formidable challenge.

[HashiCorp Consul](/consul/) provides a multi-cloud service mesh and networking 
layer to connect and
secure services. Consul is a widely deployed product, with many customers
running [significantly greater](https://www.hashicorp.com/cgsb) than 100,000 service instances in their environments.

Consul provides a distributed service mesh that pushes routing, authorization,
and other networking functions to the endpoints in the network, rather
than imposing them through middleware. This makes the network topology easier to manage, 
removes the need for expensive third party solutions, and makes service-to-service communication reliable
and scalable.

Consul's API-driven control plane integrates with sidecar proxies
alongside each service instance (proxies such as Trafik, Envoy, HAProxy, and NGINX).
These proxies provide the distributed data plane. Together, these two planes
enable a zero trust network model that secures service-to-service communication
with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Network
operation and security teams can define security policies through intentions
with logical services rather than IP addresses.

### Manage sensitive data

The first stage of HashiCorp Vault adoption is securing secrets through a centralized
location, eliminating the secret sprawl that exists today, and enabling comprehensive secret management and auditing.

Streamline the lifecycle and consumption of secret rewriting for all your 
legacy applications migrating to the cloud. 
Vault lets greenfield applications running on newer orchestration platforms, 
such as Nomad and Kubernetes, securely consume secrets.

Teams can protect applications, machines, users, and sensitive data by using Vault to 
securely store and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys. 
Vault allows you to centrally manage and securely store secrets across on-premise infrastructure 
and the cloud using a single system.

The Vault API exposes cryptographic operations developers use to secure
sensitive data without exposing encryption keys. Vault can also act as a
certificate authority to provide dynamic short-lived certificates to secure
communications with SSL/TLS. Vault also brokers access between
different platforms, such as Active Directory, AWS IAM, and LDAP to allow applications to work across platform boundaries.

Vault, running as a centralized service, enables IT teams and organizations to
provide secrets management and data encryption services across large fleets of
applications and engineering teams. Vault  globally manages policies, and
delivers consistent security through a single workflow.

### Manage identity and access

Zero trust security is predicated on securing everything based on trusted identities. 
Machine authentication and authorization, machine-to-machine access, human authentication and authorization, 
and human-to-machine access are the four foundational categories for identity-driven controls and zero trust security.

The HashiCorp [security model](/vault/docs/internals/security) is built on 
identity-based access and security principles.
 All users and machines must authenticate, and their identity and
policies authorize access and capabilities.

HashiCorp Vault issues dynamic credentials to authenticate people and machines. 
Dynamic and short-lived credentials create a multi-cloud solution that is secure and efficient.

With HashiCorp Consul, organizations can discover services, automate network
configurations, and enable secure connectivity across any cloud or runtime using
Consul service mesh. Consul defines authorization policies for services in the service mesh with the help of intentions. 
Policies of intentions control which services may establish connections between each other and facilitate for maximum scale, 
efficiency, and
security.

[HashiCorp Boundary](/boundary/) is a secure remote access solution that provides an easy way
to allow access to applications and critical systems with fine-grained
authorizations based on trusted identities. 
Boundary provides an easier way to protect clouds, local data centers, and low-trust networks by limiting 
access to application and critical systems with trusted identities without
exposing the underlying network.

Companies use different identity platforms for federated systems of record.
Leveraging these trusted identity providers is the principle of identity-based
access and security. HashiCorp products have deep integration with the leading
identity providers.

### Codify security controls

Infrastructure as Code enables codification and
automation for the four main components of infrastructure — provision, secure,
connect, and run. Infrastructure as Code allows users to create and
manage infrastructure such as compute resources, databases, security controls, and other components. 
Infrastructure automation helps lower the risk of implementing controls that negatively impact business 
operations by providing practitioners with consistent, reviewable, and automated security controls. 

Policy as Code limits exposure by codifying business and regulatory policies to
ensure infrastructure changes are safe. Together Infrastructure as Code and
Policy as Code empowers users to safely provision, secure, connect to,
and run any infrastructure for any applications.

[Sentinel](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel) is an embeddable Policy as Code framework to enable fine-grained,
logic-based policy decisions that can be extended to source external information
to make decisions. Sentinel enables Policy as Code through version control, pull review, and automate tests. You use real programming constructs to determine policy decisions beyond the limited constraints of typical ACL systems.
