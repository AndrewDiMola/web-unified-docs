# Secure distributed systems

Distributed systems involve several components communicating across networks, which presents an expanded attack surfaces with many potential points of vulnerability. A breach in one component can lead to a cascade through the system, potentially compromising data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. You must implement a robust design that include security measures to prevent data breaches and service disruptions without impairing performance and reliability.
