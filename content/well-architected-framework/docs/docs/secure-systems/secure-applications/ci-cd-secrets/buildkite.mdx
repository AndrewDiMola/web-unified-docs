# Buildkite

[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) supports a [Vault Secrets Plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/vault-secrets-buildkite-plugin) to authenticate with Vault.

Different types of secrets are supported and exposed to your builds in appropriate ways:

- Environment Variables for strings
- `ssh-agent` for SSH Private Keys
- `git-credential` via git's credential.helper

By default, the plugin references `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_VAULT_SECRETS_AUTH_SECRET_ENV (default: $VAULT_SECRET_ID)` for the `SecretID` in Vault.
