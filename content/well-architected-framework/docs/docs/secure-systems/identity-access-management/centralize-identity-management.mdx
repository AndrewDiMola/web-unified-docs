# Centralize identity management

There are several ways to grant access to systems. Most systems have built in
identity solutions that allow you to create local users and groups. Those users
and groups only have access to that specific system. While this approach may
seem like a secure approach, it does not scale well and may introduce more
security risks than centralizing identity management. 

## What is centralized identity management

Centralizing identity management allows you to manage access to all systems
from a single location. Solutions like LDAP, Active Directory, or cloud identity
providers like Okta, Azure Active Directory, or Google Cloud Identity provide a way to
centralize identity management. After you centralize authentication, you then
integrate the identity provider with other systems and authorize access for those
users. Each user has a single username and password, but can access the systems
required to perform their job.

Compare this to having a local user on your laptop. You can log into the laptop
with the local user, but that username and password do not provide access to
your email, or other systems.

## Why centralize identity management

When you manage your users through a centralized
identity provider, you can enforce strong security policies like multi-factor
authentication (MFA), password complexity, and rotation policies. 

From an end user perspective, centralizing identity management provides a
single sign-on (SSO) experience, allowing users to access the systems they need
with a single set of credentials. This approach reduces the risk of password
fatigue and improves security by reducing the number of passwords that users
need to remember.

HashiCorp tools and services integrate with several identity providers natively or through
OIDC. In addition to authenticating to HashiCorp tools and services, you can
also use HashiCorp's Vault to act as an OIDC provider for other systems.

of centralizing identity management. Identity and access management is part of the
