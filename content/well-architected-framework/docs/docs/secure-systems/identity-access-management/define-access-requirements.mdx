# Define access requirements

Defining access requirements for your organization is an important step in
creating secure systems. Identifying what requirements you need to implement can
seem overwhelming. There are steps you can take to simplify identifying which
requirements you need, and collect the necessary documentation to implement the
access requirements.

## What are access requirements

Every system you interact with today includes a set of access requirements. These
requirements define who can access the system, what actions they can take, and
under what conditions they can access the system. Access requirements come from
several sources, including:

- Industry regulations that define role-based access controls or separation of
  duties requirements (PCI, HIPAA).
- Local, federal, or international regulatory standards that define data privacy
  and protection (CCPA, Sarbanes-Oxley, GDPR).
- Current best operational practices that define security controls (SOC 2, NIST,
  ISO 127001).

Start with identifying the regulations and standards that apply to your
organization from both an industry and geographic perspective. These regulations
often map to specific security practices such as [NIST SP 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final) for access
control.

When you understand which regulations and standards apply to your organization, you can
begin to identify the specific access requirements that you need to implement
for your systems and teams.

## Why should you define access requirements

Once you have identified and collected the requirements that apply to your
organization, you need to document those requirements and begin mapping the
specific access controls to your systems and teams. Documenting these
requirements helps you ensure that you are meeting the necessary regulations and
standards.

You should also create a team responsible for staying up to date on changes to
regulations and standards that may affect your access requirements. When
regulations, standards, or best practices change, you need to update your access
requirements accordingly. The team responsible for this evangelizes the need for
strong security practices across your organization.

Documenting and maintaining your access requirements helps you ensure that you
can meet audit requirements, such as those for SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Auditors will
want to see that you have a clear understanding of your access requirements and
that you are implementing the necessary controls to meet those requirements.

As you begin defining your access requirements, also think about how you can
manage these controls at scale. HashiCorp's Terraform helps you deploy [policies
as code](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/compliance-and-governance/policy-as-code)
such as policies for Vault or Sentinel to manage access controls across your
systems.

In this section of identity and access management, you learned the importance
of identifying and collecting access requirements from common sources such as
industry and regulatory standards. Identity and access management is part of the
[secure systems](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems) pillar.
