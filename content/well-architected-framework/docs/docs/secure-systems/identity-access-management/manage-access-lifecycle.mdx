# Account management lifecycle

Ensuring users and services have the appropriate access to systems and data is a
continuous process. Managing the access lifecycle involves regularly reviewing
and updating access permissions, as well as deprovisioning access when it is no
longer needed. Properly managing the access lifecycle helps support a secure
environment and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

## What is access lifecycle management

Access lifecycle management is the process of managing user accounts and their access permissions throughout their lifecycle, from creation to deprovisioning. The management includes onboarding new users, modifying access as roles change, and removing access when it is no longer needed.

## Why manage access lifecycle

Failing to manage identity and access for users and services can lead to incidents, whether malicious or accidental. For example, if a user leaves the organization or changes roles and their account is not deprovisioned, they may still have access to systems and data to which they are not authorized.

A publishing company in the 2000s let go of one of its system administrators but failed to deprovision their account in an email system that they had not securely managed. The former employee logged in and forwarded thousands of spam emails to employees, causing a significant disruption to their day. By properly managing accounts from creation through deletion, you can avoid incidents caused by unauthorized access.

By [centralizing identity
management](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/centralize-identity-management),
you can streamline the access lifecycle for provisioning and deprovisioning
users. This allows you to update group membership, reset passwords, or
deprovision accounts when they are no longer needed.

When you combine centralized identity management with [dynamic
credentials](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/use-dynamic-credentials),
you further limit the attack surface by reducing the number of long-lived
credentials that you need to manage.

NIST SP 800-53 outlines the account management process in detail, including
the following key activities:

- Account creation and provisioning
- Account modification and review
- Account deprovisioning and removal
- Access reviews and audits

Following these practices helps you properly manage accounts and ensure
your users and services that require access to a system have access.

Combining proper lifecycle management with [securely storing
secrets](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/store-static-secrets)
and [rotating
secrets](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/rotate-secrets)
builds a strong security foundation for your organization.
