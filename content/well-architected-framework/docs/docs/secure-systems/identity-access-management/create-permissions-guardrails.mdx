# Create permissions and guardrails

Now that you have defined your access requirements, you can begin writing
policies that enforce permissions guardrails by using least privilege policies.

Creating policies and enforcing guardrails is the process of translating
requirements into policies that define what users, applications, and systems can
do. This process involves converting the requirements for each
role or function within your organization when you [defined your access
requirements](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/define-access-requirements)
into policies for your systems.

## What are permissions

Permissions are the specific actions that users, applications, or systems can
take on resources. Permissions are typically defined in policies and used to
control access to resources in a system.

You can grant or deny permissions based on a variety of factors, including
the user's role, group membership, the resource they are attempting to access,
and the context of the access request. For example, a user may have permission
to read data from a database, but not to write data to the database.

The following is an example of a database permission that follows least privilege:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The PostgreSQL role `readonly_user` with this permission can select data from
tables, but not write or modify data.

## Define permissions as code

Where possible, define your permissions in policies as code. Defining
permissions in policies as code allows you to version control your policies,
track changes over time, and collaborate with your team. You can then use tools like
HashiCorp's Terraform or Red Hat's Ansible to deploy and update your policies.
Most systems support writing policies in JSON, YAML, or XML.

Some systems like HashiCorp's Vault and Sentinel support policies in custom languages like
the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). JSON is another widely supported
format. HashiCorp Vault supports JSON based policies, in addition to HCL. AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM) supports JSON-based policies. Other systems
like Active Directory may require scripting the policies in other languages like
PowerShell.

## Next steps

In this section of **Identity and access management**, you learned the
difference between granting excessive permission and how it relates to the
concept of least privilege. Identity and access management is part of the
[secure systems](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems) pillar.
