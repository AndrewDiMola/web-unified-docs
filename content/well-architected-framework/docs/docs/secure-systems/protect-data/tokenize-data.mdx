# Tokenize data

kenization converts sensitive data into nonsensitive data called tokens.
Tokens are helpful when sensitive data is being sent out remotely, such as client authentication
like GitHub login authentication, credit card numbers, banking credentials,
or any other systems which require external authentication or data exchange.

You can use HashiCorp Vault to create tokens to secure data.
Vault Transform secrets engine
can tokenize data to replace highly sensitive data, like credit card numbers, with unique values (tokens)
that are unrelated to the original value in any algorithmic sense. Therefore,
the tokens do not risk exposing the critical data satisfying the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
(PCI-DSS) guidance.

The following diagram shows how Vault can take sensitive data, such as a customer's credit card number,
encrypt the value, and allow the application to use that credit card securely.
