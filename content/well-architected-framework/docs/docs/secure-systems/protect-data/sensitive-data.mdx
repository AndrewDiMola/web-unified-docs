# Protect sensitive data

Sensitive data is data that could cause harm if unauthorized people access it e. Examples of sensitive data include personally identifiable information, financial records, passwords, and confidential business information. Protecting sensitive data helps prevent identity theft, fraud, and other security risks.

Sensitive data most commonly falls into the confidential or restricted data [classification categories](/link-to-doc).

## Why should you protect sensitive data?

If  you do not protect data throughout all stages of it's lifecycle, you risk exposing that data. Common phases of a data lifecycle management framework includes:

- Creation (including data acquisition)
- Storage
- Usage and sharing
- Archive (including backup)
- Deletion

Once you have developed a data classification scheme for your organization, and classified your data, you should encrypt all confidential, and restricted data throughout its lifecycle.

## How to protect sensitive data

Protecting sensitive data requires a defense-in-depth approach due to the nature of how data moves across the network through the data lifecycle management process. All applications should connect using encrypted interfaces, such as enabling HTTPS on your web servers, and redirecting all traffic attempting to connect over HTTP to HTTPS.

HashiCorp Vault allows you to encrypt data using the transit secrets engine. Vault does not store the data, rather provides you with an encryption service that you can use to encrypt data received from your applications before writing to your applications storage service. When using Vault enterprise, you can also use the transform secrets engine which supports NIST vetted cryptographic standards such as format-preserving encryption (FPE). Vault is available as a self-hosted application, or you can get started with Vault quickly using the [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](link “https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in”).

[HCP Vault Radar](link “https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in”). scans connected data sources such as Azure DevOps, GitHub, Confluence, and Jira to ensure no secrets, or sensitive data is committed to version control, or written to documentation and project management tools.
HashiCorp Consul encrypts traffic using mutual transport layer security (mTLS) between services connected to the Consul service mesh. mTLS adds an additional layer of encryption transmitting data between services. Consul is available as a self-hosted application.
