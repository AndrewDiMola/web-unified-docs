## HCP-S-01: Don't hard-code passwords or secrets in your code
Hard-coding passwords or secrets in your code can lead to security vulnerabilities. Instead, use a secure secrets management solution like [HashiCorp Vault](/vault) to store and manage sensitive information. This allows you to retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime without exposing them in your codebase.

- [Vault tutorials](/vault/tutorials)

-  [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)


## HCP-S-02: Rotate secrets and keys regularly
Regularly rotating secrets and keys is essential for maintaining security. Use Vault's dynamic secrets feature to automatically generate and rotate credentials for your applications. This reduces the risk of credential leakage and ensures that your systems remain secure over time.
