# What is HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework?

HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework provides best-practice guidance for organizations. Specifically, it aims to help practitioners optimize their production HashiCorp deployments while meeting their organization's specific architectural needs. The well-architected framework starts at the [cloud operating model](https://www.hashicorp.com/cloud-operating-model), it sets the overarching goal of the framework, cloud migration enablement.

The cloud operating model provides the fundamental approach to industrialize the application delivery process across each layer of the cloud: embracing the cloud operating model, and tuning people, processes, and tools to it. HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework enables practitioners to implement the cloud operating model's approach through sets of best practices organized under pillars. 

## Framework pillars

HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework is comprised of pillars. Each pillar contains groupings of best practices. Below is an overview of each pillar.
