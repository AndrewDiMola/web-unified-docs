# Automate and define processes

The **Automate and define processes** pillar helps you build the foundation for reliable, consistent infrastructure and application delivery. This pillar focuses on creating repeatable workflows that reduce manual work and human error while building the right team culture and technical practices.

When you successfully implement this pillar, you transform from manual, error-prone processes to automated, consistent delivery pipelines. Your teams can focus on innovation instead of repetitive tasks, while improving reliability and getting new features to market faster.

## Why this matters

Automation and process definition give you immediate technical benefits and long-term business value. Automated processes eliminate the variability that causes deployment failures, configuration drift, and inconsistent environments. Your teams can deploy with confidence knowing the same tested process will run every time, reducing rollbacks and improving recovery times.

The business impact goes beyond technical improvements. Organizations that automate their processes get new features to market faster, respond more quickly to competitive pressures, and reduce operational costs. Team productivity increases as engineers solve business problems instead of doing repetitive operational work.

Automation also creates a foundation for continuous improvement. When processes are codified and automated, teams can systematically measure, analyze, and optimize their delivery pipeline. This data-driven approach helps organizations identify bottlenecks, optimize resource utilization, and continuously enhance their delivery capabilities.

## Who needs this

Technical decision makers like CTOs, architects, and staff engineers will find this pillar essential for establishing organizational delivery practices and tooling strategy. These leaders need to understand how automation practices align with business objectives and how to build organizational support for successful implementation.

DevOps engineers and platform teams are the primary implementers who will use this guidance to build and maintain automation pipelines, monitoring systems, and internal developer platforms. They need practical, actionable guidance on implementing specific automation practices and integrating them with existing tooling and processes.

Security teams will find value in understanding how to integrate security controls into automated workflows, ensuring security becomes a built-in feature rather than an afterthought.

## When to focus on this pillar

Focus on this pillar when your organization experiences frequent deployment failures, inconsistent environments, or manual processes that slow down delivery. This pillar is most valuable when you have multiple teams working on infrastructure and applications, when you need to scale operations efficiently, or when you want to reduce the time and effort required for routine tasks.

Organizations in the early stages of cloud adoption or those transitioning from traditional IT practices will find this pillar particularly valuable. It provides the foundational practices that make other optimizations possible and sustainable.

## How this fits with the framework

The Automate and Define Processes pillar serves as the foundational layer that enables the other three pillars. Without proper process automation and team culture, you cannot effectively optimize resources, build resilient systems, or implement comprehensive security controls.

Automation creates the consistency and reliability necessary for effective resource optimization. When processes are automated and repeatable, you can systematically measure performance, identify optimization opportunities, and implement changes with confidence.

Resilient systems require consistent, reliable deployment and operational practices. The Design Resilient Systems pillar builds upon this automation foundation to ensure that failover mechanisms, monitoring systems, and disaster recovery procedures operate consistently and reliably.

Security controls must be integrated into automated workflows to be effective at scale. The Secure Systems pillar relies on this automation foundation to ensure that security practices are consistently applied across all environments and deployments.

## Topics in this pillar

This pillar covers three main areas that work together to create a foundation for automated, reliable infrastructure and application delivery:

- **Team and culture** establishes the organizational foundation needed for successful automation, including DevOps culture, remote work practices, and high-performing team development.

- **Develop and deploy** covers the technical practices and tools that enable rapid, reliable delivery, including Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and modern application development practices.

- **Operations and monitoring** provides the visibility and control needed to maintain system reliability and performance, including monitoring agents, dashboards, and automated alerting.

### Team and culture

Automation success depends on organizational culture and team dynamics. Without the right mindset and collaborative practices, technical automation efforts often fail or create resistance. This section covers DevOps culture, remote work practices, process optimization principles, and team development strategies. These practices help you build high-performing teams that embrace automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement to enable effective automation implementation.

### Develop and deploy

These topics represent the core technical practices that transform manual, error-prone processes into automated, repeatable workflows that scale with organizational growth. This section covers Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, automated deployments, zero-downtime deployment strategies, and modern application development practices. These practices help you enable rapid, reliable delivery of applications and infrastructure through consistent, automated processes.

### Operations and monitoring

Automation without visibility creates blind spots that prevent teams from understanding how automated processes are performing and identifying opportunities for further optimization. This section covers monitoring agents, dashboards, automated alerting, and operational visibility tools. These practices help you provide comprehensive monitoring and observability practices essential for maintaining system reliability and performance.
