# Application deployments

This guide describes the best practices for creating an application delivery
strategy with HashiCorp tools. A well-designed deployment strategy helps you
deliver your application to production faster and catch bugs before your users
run into them. A complete deployment strategy has five fundamental components:

1. Write and test applications
1. Package applications
1. Provision infrastructure
1. Deploy applications
1. Connect and monitor applications
1. Monitor infrastructure
1. Securely access infrastructure

There are also two components to consider throughout the entire deployment process:

1. Define your security strategy
1. Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline

Operators provision infrastructure and deploy the application. The networking team connects and monitors the application and infrastructure.](/img/docs/waf/app-delivery-roles.png#light-theme-only)

Your organization may have additional requirements for delivering your
applications. For example, your security guidelines may require you to perform
static code analysis on your codebase before you package it. After you package
your application, your operations team may have a package registry that they
require you to upload your application to.

Once you identify and implement each required step of your deployment strategy,
we recommend automating them in a CI/CD pipeline. These pipelines will help
every team in your organization adopt your deployment strategy by enforcing your
designed strategy.

This guide gives our recommendations on how your organization can implement
these seven steps, and covers how HashiCorp tools can fit into that cycle.
