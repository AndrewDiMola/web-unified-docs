# What is HashiCorp's Well-Architected Framework?

HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework provides best practice guidance for organizations. Use it to optimize your production HashiCorp deployments while also meeting your specific architectural needs. The well-architected framework starts with the cloud operating model and moves toward cloud migration enablement.

The operational excellence pillar recommends strategies to enable your organization to build products quickly and efficiently; including shipping changes, updates, and upgrades. These strategies will help teams in your organization to collaborate with each other without delays or friction, even in failure scenarios. They include recommendations for both team and infrastructure architecture.

The reliability pillar recommends strategies that help prevent disruptions from a single point of failure; ensuring high availability and business continuity of your mission-critical applications and infrastructure.

The Security pillar defines a zero trust architecture approach and best practices to protect your applications, secure your networks, manage sensitive data, manage identity and access, and build security controls.
