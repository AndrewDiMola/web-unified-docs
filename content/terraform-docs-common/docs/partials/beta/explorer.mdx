<Warning>

Explorer on Terraform Enterprise is in BETA and should not be run in production environments. There may be patches or bugs during the course of the beta that require you to destroy the Explorer database entirely. Running Explorer may increase the load on the Terraform Enterprise server in unexpected ways, resulting in slowdowns or outages.

Explorer on Terraform Enterprise only has access to data to the information available in the runs from Terraform Enterprise 1.0.0 and later.

</Warning>
