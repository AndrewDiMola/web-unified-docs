# What is HCP Terraform?

> **Hands On:** Try our [What is HCP Terraform - Intro and Sign Up](/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started/cloud-sign-up) tutorial.

[HCP Terraform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) is an application that helps teams use Terraform together. It manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment, and includes easy access to shared state and secret data, access controls for approving changes to infrastructure, a private registry for sharing Terraform modules, detailed policy controls for governing the contents of Terraform configurations, and more.

HCP Terraform is available as a hosted service at <https://app.terraform.io>. Small teams can sign up for free to connect Terraform to version control, share variables, run Terraform in a stable remote environment, and securely store remote state. Paid editions allow you to add more than five users, create teams with different levels of permissions, and collaborate more effectively.

HCP Terraform **Standard** Edition allows organizations to enable audit logging, continuous validation, and automated configuration drift detection.

-> **Introducing HCP Terraform**: Effective April 22, 2024, Terraform Cloud is now HCP Terraform. HCP Terraform's functionality remains the same, and we plan to introduce new features soon to support a unified HCP experience. To learn more about HashiCorp's vision, refer to [Introducing the Infrastructure Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-infrastructure-cloud).

## What is Terraform Enterprise?

Organizations with advanced security and compliance needs can purchase [Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise), our self-hosted distribution of HCP Terraform. It offers enterprises a private instance that includes the advanced features available in HCP Terraform.

Refer to the [Terraform Enterprise Documentation](/terraform/enterprise) for requirements, reference architectures, and installation instructions.

## Use HCP Terraform in Europe

The HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) supports managing infrastructure in the Europe region. With HCP EU, your resources are hosted, managed, and billed separately to meet European data residency requirements. HCP Terraform is available in HCP EU, letting you manage Terraform resources in Europe with familiar workflows while adhering to additional [data and privacy regulations](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trust/eu).

You must create a new HCP account and organization to use HCP Europe. You cannot connect or migrate existing HCP Terraform accounts or organizations to HCP Europe. To learn more about HCP Europe benefits, accounts, availability, and billing, refer to the [HCP Europe documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe).

To get started with HCP Terraform in the EU region, sign up on the HCP EU portal: <https://eu.cloud.hashicorp.com>.

In HCP EU, the HCP platform manages organizations, projects, permissions, and groups of users. In HCP EU organizations, you can configure the following:

- [Organizations](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs)
- [Projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects)
- [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups)
- [Users](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users)
- [HCP roles](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#roles-permissions)

HCP Terraform inherits the settings of organizations, projects, groups and user roles from HCP.

In HCP Terraform you can further adjust Terraform-specific settings for the following:
- Organization settings
- User permissions
- HCP Terraform plans
- Workspaces

To learn about the available organization settings, refer to [Organizations in HCP](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs).
