# Project permissions

Project-level permissions apply to all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> within a specific project.

## Background

To learn how to set permissions for a project, refer to [Set roles in HCP Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-roles).

If you are in an HCP Terraform organization, you can manage user access and permissions through teams.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

In HCP Europe organizations, HCP Terraform inherits the groups and roles you set up in the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP). If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HCP Europe organization.

In HCP Europe organizations, HCP roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform, and you can add additional fine-grained roles within HCP Terraform itself. To learn more about HCP roles in projects, refer to [HCP group roles](#hcp-group-roles).

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

We recommend following the principle of least privilege when possible, only giving users access to the resources they need for their job function. You can also set permissions at the [organization](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization) and [workspace](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/workspace) levels.

Each permission a user is granted is additive. HCP Terraform grants a user the highest permissions possible, regardless of whether that permission was set at the organization, project, or workspace level. For more details, refer to [Effective permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#effective-permissions).

## Project roles and permissions

The following table shows the permissions granted by each project role. Each role builds upon the previous level, with Admin having the most comprehensive access.

| Permission Category | Permission | [Admin role](#project-admin) | [Maintain role](#project-maintain) | [Write role](#project-write) | [Read role](#project-read) |

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HCP Europe organization. In an HCP Europe organization, you can grant permissions through HCP and HCP Terraform roles. To learn more about assigning permissions in HCP Europe organizations, refer to [HCP group roles](#hcp-group-roles).

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

### Project admin

Each project has an **Admin** permission level that grants permissions for the project, and the workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe -->and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> that belong to that project.

Members of teams with **Admin** permissions for a project have [general workspace permissions](#workspace-permissions) for every workspace<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe -->, as well as **Admin** access for every Stack,<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the project, and the ability to do the following:
- Read and update project settings.
- Delete the project.
- Move workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> into or out of the project. This also requires project admin permissions for the source or destination project.
- Grant or revoke project permissions for visible teams. Project admins cannot view or manage access for teams that are [secret](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams/manage#team-visibility), unless those admins are also organization owners.
- Admin access for all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project, including the ability to:
  - Create, read, update, and delete workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project.
  - Initiate, cancel, or apply runs for workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the project.

#### Project maintain

The **Maintain** permission is for users who need to manage existing infrastructure in a single project, while also granting the ability to create new workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in that project. **Maintain** access grants full control of everything in the project, including the following permissions:
- Read the project name.
- Admin access for all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project, including the ability to:
  - Create, read, update, and delete workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project.
  - Initiate, cancel, or apply runs for workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the project.


#### Project write

The **Write** permission set is for people who do most of the day-to-day work of provisioning and modifying managed infrastructure. **Write** access grants the following permissions:
- Read the project name.
- Write access for all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project, including the ability to:
  - Read workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project.
  - Initiate, cancel, or apply runs for workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the project.

#### Project read

The **Read** permission set is for people who need to view information about the status and configuration of managed infrastructure for their job function, but are not responsible for maintaining that infrastructure. **Read** access grants the permissions to:
- Read the project name.
- Read access for all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project.

### Custom project role

Custom permissions enable you to assign specific and granular permissions to a team. You can use custom permission sets to create task-focused permission sets and control sensitive information.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe -->

<Note>

Stacks do not support custom group permissions.

</Note>

<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe -->

You can create a set of custom permissions using any of the permissions listed in the [Project roles and permissions](#project-roles-and-permissions) table.

Some permissions, such as the project access permission, are tiered. You can only assign one permission per category because higher-level permissions include the capabilities of lower levels.

## Project access

The following table summarizes the available project access permissions. Click on a specific permission name to learn more about that permission level.

| Permission name | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| [Read](#project-read) | View information about the project including the name. |
| [Update](#project-update) | Update the project name. |
| [Delete](#project-delete) | Delete the project. |

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

In HCP Europe organizations, you cannot assign **Project access** to a group in HCP Terraform. If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HCP Europe organization.

Instead, assign an HCP role that grants **Project access** to that group, then HCP Terraform will automatically inherit those permissions. To learn more about which HCP roles grant project access, refer to [HCP group roles](#hcp-group-roles).

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

### Read <a id="project-read"></a>

Allows users to view information about the project including the name.

### Delete workspaces

Allows users to delete workspaces in the project.

Depending on the [organization's settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#general), workspace admins may only be able to delete the workspace if it is not actively managing infrastructure. Refer to [Deleting a Workspace With Resources Under Management](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#deleting-a-workspace-with-resources-under-management) for details.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

## HCP group roles

@include 'eu/org-is-eu.mdx'

In an HCP Europe organization, you manage user access through groups. To learn how to set up groups and assign users to them in HCP, refer to [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups). You can assign permissions to HCP groups in two ways:

1. [HCP roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-roles#set-project-level-roles-for-hcp-europe-organizations) - You can assign HCP roles to groups in the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP), and these roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform.
2. [HCP Terraform roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-roles#set-project-level-roles) - Assign additional permissions at the organization, project, and workspace level to further refine group access in HCP Terraform.

Each permission a user is granted is additive. HCP Terraform grants a user the highest permissions possible, regardless of whether that permission was set by an HCP or HCP Terraform role.

The following table lists which project-level permissions each HCP role automatically grants in HCP Terraform:

| Permission Category | HCP Terraform permission name | Admin role | Contributor role | Viewer |
