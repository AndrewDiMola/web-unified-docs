# Set permissions with roles

Roles in HCP Terraform define the permissions that users have at different levels of your organization. You can assign roles at the organization, project, and workspace levels to control user access and the actions they can take.

## Background

If you are in an HCP Terraform organization, you can manage user access and permissions through **teams**.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Manage Permissions in HCP Terraform](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-permissions?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

Each permission a user is granted is additive. HCP Terraform grants a user the highest permissions possible, regardless of whether that permission was<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu --> set by an HCP or HCP Terraform role, or whether the role was<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu --> set by an organization, project, or workspace. To learn more, refer to [Effective permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#effective-permissions).

The following sections explain how to set roles at each permission level:
- [Set organization-level roles](#set-organization-level-roles)
- [Set project-level roles](#set-project-level-roles)
- [Set workspace-level roles](#set-workspace-level-roles)

### HCP Europe organizations

In an HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organization, you manage user access through **groups**.

@include 'eu/org-is-eu.mdx'

To learn how to set up groups and assign users to them in HCP, refer to [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups). You can assign permissions to groups in two ways:

1. HCP roles - You can assign HCP roles to groups in HCP, and those roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform.
2. HCP Terraform roles - Assign additional permissions at the organization, project, and workspace level to further refine group access in HCP Terraform.

The following sections explain how to set roles at each permission level:
- [Set organization-level roles for HCP Europe organizations](#set-organization-level-roles-for-hcp-europe-organizations)
- [Set project-level roles for HCP Europe organizations](#set-project-level-roles-for-hcp-europe-organizations)
- [Set workspace-level roles for HCP Europe organizations](#set-workspace-level-roles-for-hcp-europe-organizations)

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

## Set organization-level roles

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HCP Europe organization. To learn how set roles in HCP Europe organizations, refer to [Set organization-level roles for HCP Europe organizations](#set-organization-level-roles-for-hcp-europe-organizations).

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

To set organization-level permissions for a team, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to your organization's **Settings** page.
1. Click **Teams**, then select the team name from the list.
1. Assign specific permissions to apply across your organization.

For more information about what each permission grants, refer to [Organization permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization).

## Set organization-level roles for HCP Europe organizations

If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organization. If not, refer to [Set organization-level roles](#set-organization-level-roles).

If you are in an HCP Europe organization, HCP Terraform inherits the groups and roles you define in HCP. To learn about creating groups and managing users, refer to [HCP Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups). You can assign organization-level permissions to groups in two ways:

1. HCP roles - You can assign HCP roles to groups in HCP, and those roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform.
2. HCP Terraform roles - Assign additional permissions to refine access to the organization in HCP Terraform.

To add a new organization-level role for your group in HCP Terraform, perform the following steps:
1. Navigate to your organization in HCP Terraform EU, your URL must include `app.eu.terraform.io`.
1. Select **Settings**, then **Role assignments** in the side navigation.
1. Click **+ Add new assignment**, select a group to assign a Terraform role to, then click **Select group**.
1. Alternatively, expand the ellipsis next to a group, select **View organization-level permissions**, select **Manage roles**, and then click **Edit Terraform Roles**.
    - To manage your HCP organization role, you can alternatively select **Manage roles on HCP** to navigate to HCP.

To learn more about using roles and HCP groups, refer to [HCP group roles and HCP Terraform permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#hcp-group-roles-and-hcp-terraform-permissions). To learn about the specific permissions you can assign to organizations in HCP Terraform, refer to [Organization permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization).
