# Permissions overview

In HCP Terraform organizations, you control user access by collecting users into **teams** and assigning those teams permissions. To perform an action within an HCP Terraform organization, users must belong to a team that has the appropriate permissions.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

If you are in a HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organization, you can manage user access and permissions through HCP **groups** and roles and then further refine those permissions with HCP Terraform roles. To learn more, refer to [HCP group roles and HCP Terraform permissions](#hcp-group-roles-and-hcp-terraform-permissions).

## Effective permissions

The HCP Terraform permissions model is split into three levels. You can set permissions at the following scopes:
- [Organization permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization)
- [Project permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/project)
- [Workspace permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/workspace)

Each permission level is additive, granting a user the highest level of permissions possible, regardless of which scope set that permission. A team's **effective permissions** is the sum of the permissions that team has from every permission level.

The scope that you grant a permission does not matter, the level of access that the permission grants determines what a user can do.

For example, if a team has [**Manage all workspaces**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#manage-all-workspaces) permissions at the organization level, and the [**Read**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/workspace#read-role) at the workspace-level, then that team has **Manage all workspaces** permissions for that workspace. HCP Terraform grants **Manage all workspaces** on that workspace because it is the most permissive level of access.

The inverse is also true, if a team has the [**View all workspaces**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#view-all-workspaces) at the organization-level, and the [**Write**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/workspace#write-role) role on a specific workspace, then the team can **Write** on that workspace. An organization permission does not override a workspace-level permission.

We recommend following the principle of least privilege when configuring permissions. Only grant users the permissions necessary to access the resources they need for their job function.

## Set permissions with roles

To learn how to set roles for organizations, projects, and workspaces, refer to [Set permissions with roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-roles).

## HCP group roles and HCP Terraform permissions

In an HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organization, you manage user access through groups. To learn more about HCP EU, refer to [Use HCP Terraform in Europe](/terraform/cloud-docs/europe). To learn how to set up groups and assign users to them in HCP, refer to [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups).

You can assign permissions to groups in two ways:

- HCP roles - You can assign HCP roles to groups in HCP, and those roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform.
- HCP Terraform roles - Assign additional permissions at the organization, project, and workspace level to further refine group access in HCP Terraform.

We recommend following the principle of least privilege when configuring roles. HCP roles grant permissions in HCP Terraform and other HCP services. If a group only needs to manage resources in HCP Terraform, assign roles in HCP Terraform and refrain from granting more permissive HCP roles.

For example, if you want a user to be able to view all workspaces in an organization in HCP Terraform. You could assign the **View all workspaces** permission in HCP Terraform at the organization-level, instead of the more permissive **Viewer** role in HCP.

To learn how to set HCP Terraform roles for groups at the organization, project, and workspace level, refer to [Set permissions with roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-roles).

## Permissions Outside HCP Terraform's Scope

This documentation only refers to permissions that are managed by HCP Terraform itself.

Since HCP Terraform integrates with other systems, the permissions models of those systems can also be relevant to the overall security model of your HCP Terraform organization. For example:

- When a workspace is connected to a VCS repository, anyone who can merge changes to that repository's main branch can indirectly queue plans in that workspace, regardless of whether they have explicit permission to queue plans or are even a member of your HCP Terraform organization. (And when auto-apply is enabled, merging changes will indirectly apply runs.)
- If you use HCP Terraform's API to create a Slack bot for provisioning infrastructure, anyone able to issue commands to that Slack bot can implicitly act with that bot's permissions, regardless of their own membership and permissions in the HCP Terraform organization.
- When a run task sends a request to an integrator, it provides an access token that provides access depending on the run task stage:
  - For post-plan, it provides access to the runs plan json and the run task callback
  - All access tokens created for run tasks have a lifetime of 10 minutes

When integrating HCP Terraform with other systems, you are responsible for understanding the effects on your organization's security. An integrated system is able to delegate any level of access that it has been granted, so carefully consider the conditions and events that will cause it to delegate that access.
