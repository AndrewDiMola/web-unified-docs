# Use HCP Terraform in Europe

The HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) supports managing infrastructure in Europe. With HCP Europe, your resources are hosted, managed, and billed separately to meet [European data residency requirements](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trust/privacy/hcp-data-privacy).

HCP Terraform is available in HCP Europe, letting you manage Terraform resources in Europe with familiar workflows while adhering to additional data and privacy regulations. To learn more, refer to [HCP EU region and data governance](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trust/eu).

To learn more about HCP Europe, refer to the [HCP Europe documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe).

## HCP Terraform in Europe differences

If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HCP Europe organization.

In HCP Europe, your account, organization, projects, and workspaces are separate from your HCP Terraform resources in other regions. HCP Terraform also calculates billing separately for Terraform resources in HCP Europe.

In HCP Europe, you administrate HCP Terraform through the HCP platform. HCP Terraform inherits the organization, projects, and groups of users that you set up in HCP.

In HCP Europe organizations, you configure the following in the HCP platform:

- [Organizations](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs)
- [Projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects)
- [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups)
- [Users](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users)
- [HCP organization and project roles for groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#roles-permissions)

HCP Europe organizations do not support **teams**, but you can manage user access and permissions through HCP **groups** and roles. You also can further refine group permissions in HCP Terraform at the organization, project, and workspace scope. To learn more, refer to [Set permissions with roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-roles).

## Get started

You must create a new HCP account and organization to use HCP Europe. You cannot connect or migrate existing HCP Terraform accounts or organizations to HCP Europe.

To get started with HCP Terraform in the EU region, sign up on the HCP Europe portal: <https://eu.cloud.hashicorp.com>.

To learn more about HCP Europe and creating a new account, refer to the [HCP Europe documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe). To learn about the available billing and plan options, [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/contact-sales).

## Limitations

The following features are not available in HCP Europe organizations:
- Using Flex or pay-as-you-go billing.
- Manually changing HCP Terraform plans. To learn about the available billing and plan options, [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/contact-sales).
- Using [public registry namespaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations/public-namespace) to share private modules with other organizations.
- Using the [ServiceNow integration](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform).
- Using the [HCP CLI](/hcp/docs/cli).
- Using [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest) workflows.
- Using the [`tf-migrate` CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/migrate) tool.
- Setting [execution mode](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage#change-the-execution-mode) at the project level. Instead, set execution mode at the organization or workspace levels.
- HCP Terraform does not support [HCP service principals](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal).
- Deleting an organization. [Contact HCP support](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/support) to delete an HCP Europe organization.
