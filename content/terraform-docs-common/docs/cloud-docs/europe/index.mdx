# Use HCP Terraform in Europe

The HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) supports managing infrastructure in Europe. With HCP EU, your resources are hosted, managed, and billed separately to meet [European data residency requirements](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trust/privacy/hcp-data-privacy).

HCP Terraform is available in HCP EU, letting you manage Terraform resources in Europe with familiar workflows while adhering to additional data and privacy regulations. To learn more, refer to [HCP EU region and data governance](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trust/eu).

If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HCP Europe organization.

## HCP Terraform in Europe differences

In HCP EU, you can administrate HCP Terraform through the HCP platform. HCP Terraform inherits the organizations, projects, and groups of users that you set up in HCP.

In HCP EU organizations you configure the following in the HCP platform, then HCP Terraform inherits those settings:

- [Organizations](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs)
- [Projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects)
- [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups)
- [Users](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users)
- [HCP organization and project roles for groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#roles-permissions)

To learn more about setting up permissions for HCP EU organizations, refer to [Set roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-roles).

## Limitations

The following features are not available in HCP Europe organizations:
- Flex and pay-as-you-go billing plans.
- Manually changing HCP Terraform plans. To learn about the available billing and plan options, [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/contact-sales).
- The [ServiceNow integration](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform).
- The [HCP CLI](/hcp/docs/cli).
- The [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest).
- The [`tf-migrate` CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/migrate) tool.
- You cannot set [execution mode](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage#change-the-execution-mode) at the project level. You must do it at the organization or workspace levels.
- You cannot use the HCP Terraform APIs with [HCP service principals](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal).
