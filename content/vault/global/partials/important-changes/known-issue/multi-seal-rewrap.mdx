### Full seal rewraps occur on DR/PR failover with multi-seal enabled ((#multi-seal-rewrap)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change      | Affected versions                              | Fixed version |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Known issue | 1.20.x+ent, 1.19.x+ent, 1.18.x+ent, 1.16.x+ent | None          |

When failing over to a DR or performance cluster with `enable_multiseal = true`, a full rewrap occurs. This
can lead to performance degradation until the rewrap operation completes.

#### Recommendation

No workaround is available at this time, short of disabling multi-seal support.
