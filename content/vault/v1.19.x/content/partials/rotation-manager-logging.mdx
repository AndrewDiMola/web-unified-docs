### Rotation logging

The rotation manager emits logs (to the standard `vault.log`) on any successful or failed
rotation. In the case of success, the log will note which credential was rotated, under
the `rotationID` key, and the anticipated time of the next rotation, under the key `expire_time`.
In the case of failure, the log will include the `rotationID` and an `err` reason.
Other logs may be emitted, depending on the set log level. When associated with a specific
credential, the `rotationID` will be included as the first parameter.
